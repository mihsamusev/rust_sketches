# Getting started

```bash
npm run dev
```

`package.json` to tell what node modules we need which are mostly

- `webpack` and related plugins - to bundle together all our application files into `dist/`

## TODOs

- refactor buffer creations (most repeptitive verbose operation)
- rewrite sharders with `.glsl` format if there is a linter available
- put render input into structs for canvas and mouse data
- figure out how to gitignore all the nonsense
